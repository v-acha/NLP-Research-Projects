The Distributor, at its own expense, shall promote the distribution, sales, and use of Products in the Market. 1.6 Distributor's Terms and Minimum Expectations. In order to maintain the exclusive rights to sell, lease, distribute and service Products in the Market, the Distributor must use all commercially reasonably efforts to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company: On the commencement of the Term Distributor will issue to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit (\\\"LC\\\") in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The LC shall have a two (2) month term, and shall be renewed for five (5) consecutive bimonthly periods. A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order must be received by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month period. The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for Distributor's purchases, which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7.

Thus, by way of example and not limitation, if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for year two and 60 units are sold in year one and 195 units are sold in year two, the expectation for year two will have been met, but there will be no carry-over to year three.
