Enhanced Chunking Approach\n","\n","- **Issue:** The dataset contained very long contract documents (some over 8,000 tokens), but our model has a 512-token limit, causing indexing errors during training.\n","- **Solution:** We implemented chunking with a sliding window to split long documents into manageable 512-token segments while preserving context.\n","- **Method:** The function first splits the text into words, then tokenizes each chunk, enforcing a strict 512-token limit by using truncation=True.\n","**First Overlap Strategy:** We overlapped chunks by 128 tokens to prevent loss of context when splitting text, ensuring smoother clause extractions.\n","**Handling Labels:** Instead of assigning all labels to every chunk, we filtered labels so that each chunk only contains the clauses present in that section, avoiding hallucination issues.\n","**Final Output:** The model will now train on many short, structured examples rather than long, unmanageable documents, improving extraction accuracy and preventing token errors.\n","\n","**Improved Label from first baseline** Rather than showing model chunks with no inputs or questions, we add questions in every chunk so the
